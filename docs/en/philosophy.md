# Philosophy of project

## Imagine you are running your own business or just taking the first steps to start one. 
In any of these situations you need customers, don't you? 
Our SalesGuru project is designed to help you do just that by providing tools to attract customers from a variety of online channels, both obvious and hidden.

### We know that there are already programs for automating marketing on services such as Telegram and WhatsApp and other social networks, but they have a number of drawbacks:
1. They often require you to install and run them on your personal computer.
2. Developed primarily for Windows and focused on a single social network.
3. License prices are often inflated.
4. Difficult to master because of the abundance of settings and the need to devote time to studying documentation or training courses.
5. Interruptions in the computer or internet connection can interrupt the advertising campaign.
6. High consumption of computer resources during the mailing, which excludes the possibility of using it for other tasks.


### SalesGuru project offers you a revolutionary approach:
1. All campaigns are automated on our servers, which eliminates the need to own powerful hardware.
2. Our solution is available on all types of devices and operating systems: Linux, iOS, Android, Windows, MacOS. We offer a mobile app, PC program, and PWA-enabled website, providing versatility and accessibility.
3. For those who prefer to work locally, we provide a PC version of the program.
4. Flexible and fair pricing policy, allowing you to customize your campaign according to your budget.
5. You don't need to watch training courses to work with our program, everything is as simple as possible.
6. If you like to customize everything, you just need to specify it in the settings - and all possible settings will open up to you

## Results:
1. Our project sets new standards, outperforming the competition on key features. 
2. You save money by paying only for what you need.
3. Create advertising campaigns anywhere and anytime using any device.
4. Our product is of high quality and performance across all platforms.
5. Further development is planned to integrate with multiple social networks and offer a variety of campaign types for each.
6. Just promote your business, focus on business objectives, not on technical and unnecessary details
